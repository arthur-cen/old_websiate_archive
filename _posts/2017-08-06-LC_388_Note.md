This problem is not hard but needs deep understanding on what you need to do. I ended up study the solution posted on Discussion tab, thanks to [@sky-xu](https://discuss.leetcode.com/user/sky-xu).

## Study Note for LeetCode 388. Longest Absolute File Path
### Problem Description
Read [here](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-absolute-file-path/description/)
### Explanation
The basic idea is, after splitting the long string by the newline String, "\n", we need to deal with the Tab String "\t". The level of a directory or file is dependent on the number of "\t" in each substring. However, it assumes that neither directory name nor file name contains "\t", otherwise the code below does not work. 

### Solution

```
public class Solution {
    public int lengthLongestPath(String input) {
        Deque<Integer> stack = new ArrayDeque<>();
        String[] arr = input.split("\n");
        int maxLen = 0;
        stack.push(0); //dummy null length
        for (String s: arr) {
            /*
            numOfTabs is the number of "\t", numOfTabs = 0 
            when "\t" is not found, because s.lastIndexOf("\t") returns -1.
            So normally, the first parent "dir" have numOfTabs 0.
            */
            int numOfTabs = s.lastIndexOf("\t") + 1;
            /* Level is defined as numOfTabs + 1. 
            For example, in "dir\n\tsubdir1\n\tsubdir2\n\t\tfile.ext", 
            dir is level 1, subdir1 and subdir2 are level 2, file.ext is level3
            */
            level = numOfTabs + 1;
            /*
            The following part of code is the case that we want to consider when there are
            several subdirectories in a same level. We want to remove
            the path length of the directory or the file of same level
            that we added during previous step, and calculate 
            the path length of current directory or file that we are currently looking at.
            */
            while (level < stack.size()) stack.poll(); 
            int curLen = stack.peek() + s.length() - numOfTabs + 1;
            stack.push(curLen);
            //Only update the maxLen when a file is discovered, 
            if (s.contains(".")) maxLen = Math.max(maxLen, curLen - 1); 
            // And remove the "/" at the end of file
        }
        return maxLen;
    }
}
```

### A clearer version of code without comments:

```
public class Solution {
    public int lengthLongestPath(String input) {
        Deque<Integer> stack = new ArrayDeque<>();
        String[] arr = input.split("\n");
        int maxLen = 0;
        stack.push(0);
        for (String s: arr) {
            int numOfTabs = s.lastIndexOf("\t") + 1;
            level = numOfTabs + 1;
            while (level < stack.size()) stack.poll(); 
            int curLen = stack.peek() + s.length() - numOfTabs + 1;
            stack.push(curLen);
            if (s.contains(".")) maxLen = Math.max(maxLen, curLen - 1);
        }
        return maxLen;
    }
}
```
